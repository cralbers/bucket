title: "about"
---

just a kid running around pretending to be a fake-adult. i like to read and listen to music and people watch and play video games and hang out with my friends in the middle of the street late at night and exercise and learn new things. i unabashedly call my mom or dad most everyday and have a collection of mini things on my windowsill and am deadly afraid of being bored and alone (both separately and at once). this is just where i dump things to feel like i am giving my brain a shower, or get the tv static out of my joints and brain.
