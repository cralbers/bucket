this was brilliant. the characters are so dense and real and the story is intriguing and full of mystery and adventure and surprises and i loved it. i especially loved how love was portrayed- the themes of navigating platonic love when the other person has huge differences of opinion or just generally when rifts appear in a friendship are so well done. also, the discussions of colonialism and how not to be blind in your privilege are well expanded and really well navigated. definitely the second half of the book got way more adventurous and exciting than i thought it would, just based on the slower pace of the beginning, but it made sense with the building presence of the Hermes Society and things just finally becoming unavoidable. overall extraordinary.
