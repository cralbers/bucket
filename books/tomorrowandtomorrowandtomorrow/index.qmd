This is a story about some people with the normal type of messed up lives. The characters are well formed and the narration of their inner thoughts is woven together so seamlessly that the book flows through their timeline in such a way that you don't realize the book is over until it is and you wish it wasn't.

i got my hands on a paperback copy of this one in scotland and then had to read it again- just as good as the first time. i loved being able to read portions of the beginning knowing how things were going to pan out because i just got so much more out of it. lovely and brilliant
