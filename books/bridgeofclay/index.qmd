it’s lyrical and masterful, a lot like singing or riding a horse or telling a story, there’s a rhythm to it, it ebbs and flows. cried through the last 50 pages, made me feel boneless. god i love my family. the writing can make the story a bit confusing to follow, but it's tragic and brilliant anyways. reminded me of this music:
- gregory alan isakov (artist)
- the bride and the bachelor / magnolian
- girl in calico live with skylightcity string quartet / tow'rs
