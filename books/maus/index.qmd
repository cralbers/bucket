jesus christ this was devastating and beautifully written and illustrated. i really love non-fiction graphic novels because they are able to portray so much emotion, and this was no different. the use of animals to make differences between people so blatant was brilliant. i also really liked how spiegelman incorporated the struggles of his relationship with his dad while also attempting to understand what he endured through the holocaust. so so intelligent and well-done.
