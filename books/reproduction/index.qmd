all of the men were assholes in this book. there was a thing one of the characters brought up which was "contributing to the GDP of the house" and it was pretty funny because he was 36, in a serious amount of debt and living in his mom's basement. you can tell a poet wrote this book. i like the switchups of narrative style, and there were a lot of plot points that came by surprise which was cool. the last section was a slog to get through, just because of the writing style, but damn did it make me think about how i consider families and love as intertwined concepts, and maybe they aren't always in a matrix? i dunno
