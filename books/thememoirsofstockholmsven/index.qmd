I have never really read a story like this. The setting and environment was so unique, and in an area i had never even heard of, which was so fascinating to learn about. also i just liked that the story wasn't about one romantic relationship, or someone's life's mission, but was more about a life lived learning about companionship and isolation and how to be a person. just a really singular and unique story- really loved it.

also should i go on the Arctic Circle Expeditionary Program?? (https://thearcticcircle.org/)
