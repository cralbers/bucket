i started reading this book fully thinking that it was fiction, and was subsequently really shocked when i looked it up on storygraph and figured out that it was in fact non-fiction. i'm not sure i have ever read a non-fiction book quite like this one- there is so much dialogue that it reads really easily, and it makes the characters so much more lively. the writing and terminology is definitely dated, but the story is so exciting and really keeps you reeled in. i can't believe [jim williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Arthur_Williams) was tried 4 times, found guilty the first 3 times, and then acquitted at the last trial! crazy shit. anyways, really liked this one, would recommend to anyone who just wants a story about weird whacky humans living in a bubble where a murder happens.
