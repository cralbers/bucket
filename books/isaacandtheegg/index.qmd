this one was so so good. i picked it up in scotland because it was buy one get one half off and i needed the paperback of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow so i just grabbed it because of the title. it's really sad (about a husband grieving the death of his wife) but so brilliantly written. also the egg is hilarious.
