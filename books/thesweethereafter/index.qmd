i really liked the writing style of this book - i am always impressed when authors are able to create such unique and individualized voices for different characters to the point that you can tell who is narrating without the author having to explicitly state whose point of view the story is currently being told from. the story is really tragic, and i wanted resolution at the end for Nichole and for her dad to go to prison for a long long time. but i guess the point is that everyone grieves their own tragedies differently, but it made me sad that dolores felt so much relief at being blamed for the accident and that she lost her community (except for abbott). overall i really liked it, but it made me sad too.
