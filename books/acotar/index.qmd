**finished 6/4/23**   \
this book was one i had resisted reading for a long time because it's so controversial and didn't really seem like something up my alley. i really did not like feyre (also how tf do you say that name) - she just made everything worse and generally was just a whiner. there were definitely some parts that were good plot-wise and the villain was fantastic, but overall i skimmed this one.
