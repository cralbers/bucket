this one was a long one (>600 pgs), but very glad i read it. super funny and addresses the lives of teenagers and kids in a really honest way. the language the author uses to write the dialogue of the boys is so genuine and hilarious and the characters are so well developed. gets pretty sad at the end (spoiler: skippy does die) but it's handled with grace and truth. fantastic read.
