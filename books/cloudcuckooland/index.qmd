i really liked this one- mama said she didn't like it so much because there wasn't really a moral or something obvious to get out of it, which i think is why i really liked it. it was just a story about people telling stories, and there wasn't any greater meaning that was being forced down my throat. also i love the name and the story cloud cuckoo land is really pretty funny. omeir's oxen moonlight and tree broke my heart.
