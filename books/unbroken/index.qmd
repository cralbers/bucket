**finished 10/2/24** \
this story is told so matter of factly, and the things that happen to Louie seem so unreal, that it is hard to remember at times that it's a true story and not some ridiculous fiction. really makes you think about what it means to be internally strong and resilient, and gave me a great admiration for survivors of POW camps- the dehumanization is abhorrent. real good read, but a hard one to swallow.
