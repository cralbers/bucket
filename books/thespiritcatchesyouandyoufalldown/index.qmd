What would you do? The parents love their daughter unconditionally the only way they know how, and the doctors want to heal her unrelentlessly the only way they know how. The second to last chapter is called "The Life or the Soul" and that pretty much sums it up. How do you fix a problem created by the fact that no one party is correct- a war of moralities and differences of opinion in which there is no true positive? I think probably the first step is to listen to each other.
