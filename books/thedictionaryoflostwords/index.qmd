i really liked this one! the language was so beautiful, and the feminist themes were really well expounded upon. the extreme challenges of being a working woman in the late 19th - early 20th century were presented just subtly enough to get the point across without having to be blatant about the themes she was addressing. i thought the plot was beautiful, and it was really interesting to learn about the making of the first dictionary also.
