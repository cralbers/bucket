**finished 4/4/24** \
for the sake of honesty, i have read this before, but evidently had forgotten because i didn't remember that until the third chapter or so. anyways, amazing journalism, it's a tragic story but the book is so well researched and the story is told very well. I do wish that I had some type of background that had given me boat and ocean and fishing knowledge, because I think I would have understood a ton more, but that's also partially on me because I didn't really do a lot (any) looking into terms that were confusing and just sort of relied on context clues to understand what was going on. but anyways, the ocean is insane and I am definitely not destined to be a fisherman on a swordfish boat.
