**finished 3/12/23** \
a book has never made me feel so un-informed (is that a word?). the Troubles were, and continue to be, such a tragedy for all of Ireland, and the people who were directly affected will carry it forever. there was no sugarcoating of anything, or pretending it wasn't as bad as it was. i am really interested to see what becomes of the Belfast Project at Boston College - it was such a fascinating idea that ended up going completely awry. anyways, this piece of history is a huge can of worms and i think i've got a lot more reading to do about it but this book is phenomenally done.
