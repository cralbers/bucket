this was a weird one. at first it was a slow-burn murder and then it sped up and got pretty fast paced and really exciting which was a big switch up. i really liked how all of the characters eventually intertwined, but it was a little bit confusing to pick up the plot at the beginning because the language could be pretty languorous and abstract, which isn't bad but was a little tricky because of the omniscient narrator situation. also the cover art is so sick. \
other random thoughts I had while reading this book that i wrote down on a receipt:
- writing matches tone of scenes
- words and sentences thick like molasses
- have to reread to understand some parts because a lot goes over my head
