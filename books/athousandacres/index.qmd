contrary to what i assumed based on the author's last name, this is not a happy book. i do understand why it won a pulitzer though- the writing is stunning and the characters (sans narrator) are so grossly horrible to each other in these intensely personal and pointed ways, which just proves the strength of smiley's writing. makes me appreciate my own sisters and that i haven't ever been mad enough to construct a premeditated murder plot based off of sausages in a jar.
