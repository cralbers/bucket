**finished 4/23/24**
- really want to watch the movie now
- a little bit sappy, but a wicked story overall
- super interesting to learn more about the 1936 Olympics under Hitler, and all of the insane propaganda and lying that was going on during the games
- loved that the crew continued to get together to row on the 10 year anniversaries of their win
