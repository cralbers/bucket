phenomenal. the blend of his personal stories and experiences with hardcore science, as well as the lyrical language surrounding all of the fascinating history around the discovery of the different parts of the cell is brilliant. i was just as amazed as i was reading **The Gene** because he is able to craft these intricate and complex scientific histories into dramatic and understandable and riveting stories. loved it.
