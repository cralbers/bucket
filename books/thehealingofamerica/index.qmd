Makes you do some big thinking about the selfishness of US government. I really liked Reid's approach of first researching and getting first hand experience with health care systems of other nations that are comparable to the US in other metrics, and then broaching the topic of actually reforming our health care system- I thought it was well thought out and researched, and provided realistic suggestions for action. Also, the dedication really sticks it to people who argue that we shouldn't take inspiration from other countries, which is pretty fun.
