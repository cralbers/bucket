A book about a girl and her sister and their mother who leaves them out of love with her father who she is learning to forgive. I liked this one until the eleven year old narrator was sexually assaulted behind a dumpster, which was then used as an experience that, once revealed, brought her closer to her sister, who had been physically abused by their now deceased father. However, neither of these traumatic events were brought to any type of resolution, and then the book just kind of ended, and we should be telling girls every goddamned day that they should not have to live with those things, carrying those heavy weights.
