This was really damn good. It was interesting reading kingsolver writing a male narrator because so far I've only read ones of hers that are narrated by women. The writing style is stunning, because she figured out a way to give an accurate voice to this uneducated, wicked smart kid that doesn't dumb him down or make him unrelatable. Demon's blunt self-awareness of his self destruction at the end is so heartbreaking, but I liked the ending I think. The biggest part that resonated with me was the whole thing about the city vs. the green grass and always wanting to be back with who and where you came from and not liking the dead quiet that exists without cicadas or the rain or birds. I'm a little homesick.
