ok this was a really cool read- i love books where all the characters end up being connected in some way, and this was exactly that. the writing style was really unique and lyrical, and i loved the intimacy/closeness of the story and the characters despite being in the huge setting of nyc. i don't know, i like reading about people. sometimes it's easier to read about them than talk to them.
