**finished 4/6/24** \
hey what? to be fair (to be fairrrrr) i did pick this up from goodwill without reading the  blurb or reading anything about it online. here are my thoughts in bullet point format
- wtf
- was not prepped for the sexual assault of a minor in the third chapter
- kind of hard to track the plot sometimes because the language is languishing and exploratory and feels meandering
- but also the language is beautiful? "the god of small things" god what a beautiful phrase
- loved the unconventional capitalized phrases
- devastating and upsetting
- good i think
- need to think more about it 
- political pieces are very interesting - realized I know next to nothing about the politcal plane of India in the late 60s post British liberation
