i don't often read fiction books that make me feel as understood or perceived as this book did. it's about three daughters listening to their mom's story of a summer romance with a famous actor years ago. they are all at home because of the pandemic, and having to find ways to entertain themselves. it's told from the mom's perspective, and she talks about her daughters and how to give them pieces of her past self and also keep some for herself and the differences between her daughters and none of this makes a lot of sense but this book was so wonderful and it just made me feel heard.
