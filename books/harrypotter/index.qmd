been re-reading the harry potter series in an attempt to get out of my reading slump. just going to plop all of the reviews on one page here because seven hp pages seemed excessive.

**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone** \
so much fun- I really forgot how enjoyable these are to read.

**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets** \
snake

**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban** \

**Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire** \

**Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix** \
