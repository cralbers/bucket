**finished 4/20/23**
already want to re-read this one. the characters are so individualized, which is super impressive given that there are 6 different storylines in significantly different settings, that somehow manage to be woven together in this beautiful and elegant way. can't begin to understand how you think of or write something this complex, but this book is phenomenal nonetheless.
