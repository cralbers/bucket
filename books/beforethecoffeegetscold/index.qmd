aunt jody got me this one for christmas this year, and it was a really great read! it's almost told in 4 different mini stories, but they all have the same base characters, which carries a nice continuity through the stories. mostly it's just about people and their grief and how they choose to heal from it in very human ways. i wish i could read japanese, because i'm sure reading it without the barrier of translation is beautiful.
