definitely adding this one to my re-read list. the story is so complex, and it's really impressive how given that, the story is still clear and easy to understand. i love the characters because even though they are supposed to be gods, they are really closer to real people. they have flaws and and can die and want to be loved. i want to read the comic because i wonder how the visuals in my head compare to how Gaiman envisioned them. i don't know, i really liked this one.
